        Title: "Introduction to C",
        Content: "C is a foundational programming language known for its efficiency and flexibility. Developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in the early 1970s, it's procedural and structured, organizing programs around functions and blocks for clear logic and management. With a balance of low-level capabilities and high-level constructs, C offers portability across platforms and a powerful Standard Library for essential operations. Its static typing ensures early error detection, making it reliable for system-level programming and performance-critical applications like embedded systems and operating systems development. Learning C provides a robust foundation in programming concepts, ideal for those interested in system-level understanding and high-performance computing.",

    Content : "Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are fundamental concepts in computer science that enable efficient data organization, storage, and retrieval, as well as algorithmic problem-solving. Data structures like arrays, linked lists, trees, and graphs provide ways to organize data, while algorithms are step-by-step procedures for solving specific problems or performing computations. Mastery of DSA is essential for designing efficient software systems, optimizing performance, and tackling complex computational tasks.",
